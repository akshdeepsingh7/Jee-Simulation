## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server (optional, but recommended for JSON loading)

### Installation

1. **Download the files**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/akshdeepsingh7/Jee-Simulation.git
   cd Jee-Simulation
   
   # Or download as ZIP from GitHub
   ```

2. **Create your question bank**
   - Use the provided `questions.json` format (see structure below)
   - Organize questions by sections

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Simple file opening (may have CORS issues)
   # Just open index.html in your browser
   
   # Option 2: Local server (recommended)
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using Live Server (VS Code extension)
   # Right-click on index.html ‚Üí "Open with Live Server"
   ```

4. **Access the test**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Click "Start Test" to begin

## üìÅ File Structure

```
jee-simulation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.json      # Question database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

## üìù Question Format

The `questions.json` file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "Physics": [
    {
      "text": "What is the SI unit of force?",
      "options": ["Newton", "Joule", "Watt", "Pascal"],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "text": "Which law states F = ma?",
      "options": ["First Law", "Second Law", "Third Law", "Universal Law"],
      "correct": 1
    }
  ],
  "Chemistry": [
    {
      "text": "What is the atomic number of Carbon?",
      "options": ["4", "6", "8", "12"],
      "correct": 1
    }
  ],
  "Mathematics": [
    {
      "text": "What is the derivative of x¬≤?",
      "options": ["x", "2x", "x¬≤", "2x¬≤"],
      "correct": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Question Object Properties
- `text`: The question statement (string)
- `options`: Array of 4 answer choices (array of strings)
- `correct`: Index of the correct answer (0-3) (number)

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Changing Test Duration
Edit the JavaScript variable in `index.html`:
```javascript
let timeLeft = 10 * 60; // Change 10 to desired minutes
```

### Modifying Scoring
Update the scoring logic in the `calculateResults()` function:
```javascript
score += 4; // Points for correct answer
score -= 1; // Points deducted for wrong answer
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Questions not loading**
- Ensure `questions.json` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Use a local server instead of opening the file directly

**Timer not working**
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Ensure the browser supports modern JavaScript features

**Responsive issues**
- Clear browser cache
- Check viewport meta tag is present
- Test on different screen sizes

### Error Messages

- **"Could not load questions"**: JSON file missing or malformed
- **Timer shows "NaN"**: JavaScript execution error
- **Buttons not responding**: Event listeners not attached properly
